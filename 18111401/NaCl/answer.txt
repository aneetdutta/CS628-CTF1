In NacL problem we need to understand the otp_gen machanism.

The otp is generated by appending some value like 1548945830username (passed) as an argument.

By seeing the time function we understood that this appended part is the epoch time. Then we tried with several epoch time and finally succeeded with the modify time of pass.db.

So, my otp was MD5(epochtime(Modify,pass.db)username<aneetk>)
