To call the target function getFlag() format string vulnerabilty is used.

arg[0]: 0x565559a7 ("Entered plain text: %s\n")

There is a test condition : test   eax,eax which needs to fail to get the flag.

EAX:$ebp-0x1c = 0xffffdb5c.

By exploiting the format string vulnerability, execute printf("address%x%x%x...%n") , the %n will write in the address location 0xffffdb5c some non-zero value.



after encryption the string="address%x%x%x...%n". 

The key is calculated and it is used to send the string in the required format.
